How To Install SevTech Ages (Client)

1. download the modpack zipfile from the project page here:
https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/sevtech-ages

2. download MultiMC, an open-source tool for managing multiple minecraft
instances (who knew there would ever be such a thing?). It is able to
import modpacks and encapsulate them in their own launchable instance.
https://multimc.org/#Download

MultiMC is preferable to the Twitch launcher that seems to now be the "official"
method of installing mods.

3. Run MultiMC, select 'Add Instance', then 'load from zip file'
and point it to the zipfile downloaded in the first step.

NOTE: If this is your first time running MultiMC, you will have to
add a valid mojang account in the preferences.

that's all!

Tweaks
===
There are a _ton_ of mods in this pack.
When I launched with the default heap settings
(min 512M, max 1024M) minecraft crashed before
it could load all the mods.

even bumping this to 1024/2048 left a lot
of pressure on the heap.
